1. What are PDOs? What is a DSN?
   PDOS are a built in class that comes packaged with PHP to make it very easy for you to interact with databases.
   Through this connection, we run queries and PHP is going to take sql as input and return results from the database 
   and stroe it in a variable. It represents and manages the connection to the database. In order to establish this 
   connection we insranriate PDO objects with a DSN (Data Sourse Name) string. DSN is a string that contains 
   information about our connection.

2. What are .env files? What are .gitignore files?
   An .env file is a file that contains environment varaibles, which are variables whose values are set outisde the 
   program. The file will exist in the environemnt we are running our application on and set variables specific to 
   the environment. A gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project. We 
   use git toignore our .env file.

3. Should you ever upload passwords of any kind to github?
   No you should not.

4. What is SQL injection?
   SQL injection is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious 
   code through user input fields. This can result in unauthorized access to, or modification of, a database.

5. What are prepared statements? How can we pass variables to a prepared statement?
   Prepared statements are precompiled SQL queries with placeholders for variables, designed to prevent SQL injection 
   by separating query logic from data. Variables are passed to prepared statements using execute() in PDO, either as 
   an associative array for named placeholders (:placeholder) or as a sequential array for positional placeholders (?).
